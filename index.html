            <p>Wealthy white women frequently depict themselves as self-made success stories regardless of the way they got there.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="elaborate">
        <p>Trisha Paytas, Erika Jayne Girardi, and Chaya Raichik have simultaneously painted themselves as victims and self-made success stories, when in reality they have attained their capitalistic success through exploitation and bigotry, even illegally and through literal fraud.
        These women have been placed on a pedestal with the rhetoric and repertoire of white liberal feminism, which emphasizes capitalistic success and simply having the ability to mirror the actions of men, while not accounting for the duplicities of gender, class, and race, and liberation from capitalist systems of exploitation.
        Paytas, Girardi, and Raichik do not feel guilt for their own financial successes, their stories of what they claim to be hard, honest work, and their role in enforcing strict binary gender structures.
        The true story, and the people who suffered for their success, contrasts greatly to the one they portray.</p>
        <p>These women have been selected for this project based off of three criterion:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="pin-cushion">
        <h3 class="tag" id="queer-tag">Proximity to Queerness</h3>
        <h3 class="tag" id="victim-tag">Claiming Victimhood</h3>
        <h3 class="tag" id="exploit-tag">Exploitation of Marginalized Communities</h3>
        <p class="info" id="queer-info-notactive">Each of these women has in some way, shape, or form profitted off of the queer community by purposefully or accidentally aligning themselves directly against or 'for' the community. Erika Jayne marketing herself as a queer icon and failing, Trisha Paytas being an accidental queer icon out of irony, and Chaya Raichik's position as a leader of the crusade against LGBT teachers in schools has brought each of them financial gain.</p>
        <p class="info" id="victim-info-notactive">By painting themselves as a victim, these women have attempted to avoid accountability for their actions that have harmed others. The status of victimhood is also typically reserved for white women, and they have sought to take advantage of that and absolve themselves of responsibility.</p>
        <p class="info" id="exploit-info-notactive">The most important connecting thread at play is the fact that each of these women have profited off harming marginalized communities, and then turn around paint themselves as feminist icons who are 'girlbosses,' revealing the conflicting goals of feminism and capitalism.</p>
