One example: her claims that she would vote for Mitt Romney because he was ‘hot’ [<a href="https://twitter.com/trishapaytas/status/255828071008067586?lang=en">4</a>] and his first name rhymed with ‘tit.’ [<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trisha-paytas-mitt-romney-supporter-video_n_1954847">5</a>] [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgWaZ1D1QYs">6</a>] While the video is now deleted, as is the video of their ‘Japanese alter ego,’ Trishii, (Paytas in horrific racial caricature makeup), [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11quii2G22k">7</a>] the amount of press she received for posting these videos encouraged her to continue creating content like this.</p>

                    <p>Paytas has historically been open about her history with plastic surgery; she admits to having filler, breast augmentation, liposuction, and a Brazilian butt lift. She has stated, “There’s no one body part of me that is real.” [1, 2]</p>

                    <p>Her book, “Curvy and Loving It” (2014), is a rambling attempt at a self-help book, described on the cover to be “a no-nonsense guide to loving your body, curves and all, this uplighting collection shares all the tips and advice that Paytas herself uses when it seems the world is trying to get her down.”</p>
                    <p>Paytas has an OnlyFans and has stated that 70% of their income derives from it, accruing approximately one million dollars a year. [5]</p>

While some of this may appear as petty drama or gossip, it’s important to remember that between Jeffree Star, Trisha Paytas, and Shane Dawson, there are a combined 42.5 million subscribers, and millions of dollars at stake — Jeffree Star earned 18 million in 2018 from YouTube alone. Additionally, these actions that these creators get ‘cancelled’ for range from dabbling in Nazism, modern minstrelsy, and promoting violence towards women of color to a young, impressionable audience of millions. </h3>

[<a href="https://www.insider.com/trisha-paytas-shane-dawson-timeline-jeffree-star-trevi-moran-oscar-2021-1">3</a>] Paytas seemed to fall out with Dawson over this, but October 7, 2021, Paytas announced via livestream that she supported Dawson’s return to YouTube, saying: "I think everyone makes mistakes. I think everyone deserves to be forgiven. I feel like, you know, everyone deserves second or third chances. As a public figure do you have to give that? No. If you don't like him, you don't like him but he has something that is just very charming and magnetic, and people like him.” [<a href="https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/shane-dawson-trisha-paytas-cancelled-video/">4</a>]</p>

                <p>In 2019, Dawson was forced to make a statement vehemently denying any type of sexual contact with his cat, after a 2015 podcast clip of him was unearthed saying he had performed sex acts on his cat. 'One time, I laid my cat down on her back,' he said, before adding that he 'came all over her'.

                <p>Jeffree Star is an American YouTuber, producing beauty content, and is the founder and owner of Jeffree Star Cosmetics. He joined YouTube in 2006. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffree_Star">1</a>] In 2018, Star earned 18 million dollars from his YouTube endeavors alone. This section does not cover all of Star's racist and harmful actions; because his racist aggressions were so frequent, this section seeks to highlight the most prominent examples.</p>
                <p>Paytas and Star first filmed a collaboration video in 2018, after Dawson partnered with him first in 2017. [<a href="https://jezebel.com/the-end-of-youtubes-longest-friendship-shane-dawson-vs-1846172826">2</a>] In February of 2020, Paytas, Star and a couple others took a trip to Las Vegas during which Paytas claims Star admonished her for her weight and eating habits, and previous drug abuse. By September of that year, on the Frenemies podcast with Ethan Klein of H3H3, Paytas confirmed the end of the relationship with Star. [ibid] In early 2021, Star’s former stylist took to Instagram to call Paytas a ‘walrus,’ with ‘warts.’ Paytas revealed that same day that Dawson private told her that he would not admonish Star publicly, and would continue to host him on his podcast, resulting in Paytas blocking Dawson and his fiancé that day.</p>
