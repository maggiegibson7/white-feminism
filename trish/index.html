                    <p>Paytas has historically been open about her history with plastic surgery; she admits to having filler, breast augmentation, liposuction, and a Brazilian butt lift. She has stated, “There’s no one body part of me that is real.” [1, 2]</p>

                    <p>Her book, “Curvy and Loving It” (2014), is a rambling attempt at a self-help book, described on the cover to be “a no-nonsense guide to loving your body, curves and all, this uplighting collection shares all the tips and advice that Paytas herself uses when it seems the world is trying to get her down.”</p>
                    <p>Paytas has an OnlyFans and has stated that 70% of their income derives from it, accruing approximately one million dollars a year. [5]</p>

While some of this may appear as petty drama or gossip, it’s important to remember that between Jeffree Star, Trisha Paytas, and Shane Dawson, there are a combined 42.5 million subscribers, and millions of dollars at stake — Jeffree Star earned 18 million in 2018 from YouTube alone. Additionally, these actions that these creators get ‘cancelled’ for range from dabbling in Nazism, modern minstrelsy, and promoting violence towards women of color to a young, impressionable audience of millions. </h3>

                <p>Trisha Paytas and Shane Dawson have been creating content together since 2014, even earning the nickname “Trane.” [<a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/01/28/trisha-paytas-shane-dawson-jeffree-star-youtube-drama-timeline/">1</a>] Dawson begins collaborating with Jeffree Star in 2017, leading to Dawson’s docuseries on him in August 2018, “The Secret World of Jeffree Star,” and another in 2019, “The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star,” which documented their collaboration on a makeup palette for Star’s beauty brand, which included a hot-pink eyeshadow shade appropriately named “Trisha.” [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Dawson">2</a>] After Star’s and Paytas’s fallout in July 2020, Dawson did not rebuke Star and appeared to maintain the friendship, though did not comment publicly. [<a href="https://www.insider.com/trisha-paytas-shane-dawson-timeline-jeffree-star-trevi-moran-oscar-2021-1">3</a>] Paytas seemed to fall out with Dawson over this, but October 7, 2021, Paytas announced via livestream that she supported Dawson’s return to YouTube, saying: "I think everyone makes mistakes. I think everyone deserves to be forgiven. I feel like, you know, everyone deserves second or third chances. As a public figure do you have to give that? No. If you don't like him, you don't like him but he has something that is just very charming and magnetic, and people like him.” [<a href="https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/youtubers/shane-dawson-trisha-paytas-cancelled-video/">4</a>]</p>

                <p>In 2019, Dawson was forced to make a statement vehemently denying any type of sexual contact with his cat, after a 2015 podcast clip of him was unearthed saying he had performed sex acts on his cat. 'One time, I laid my cat down on her back,' he said, before adding that he 'came all over her'.

                <p>Jeffree Star is an American YouTuber, producing beauty content, and is the founder and owner of Jeffree Star Cosmetics. He joined YouTube in 2006. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffree_Star">1</a>] In 2018, Star earned 18 million dollars from his YouTube endeavors alone. This section does not cover all of Star's racist and harmful actions; because his racist aggressions were so frequent, this section seeks to highlight the most prominent examples.</p>
                <p>Paytas and Star first filmed a collaboration video in 2018, after Dawson partnered with him first in 2017. [<a href="https://jezebel.com/the-end-of-youtubes-longest-friendship-shane-dawson-vs-1846172826">2</a>] In February of 2020, Paytas, Star and a couple others took a trip to Las Vegas during which Paytas claims Star admonished her for her weight and eating habits, and previous drug abuse. By September of that year, on the Frenemies podcast with Ethan Klein of H3H3, Paytas confirmed the end of the relationship with Star. [ibid] In early 2021, Star’s former stylist took to Instagram to call Paytas a ‘walrus,’ with ‘warts.’ Paytas revealed that same day that Dawson private told her that he would not admonish Star publicly, and would continue to host him on his podcast, resulting in Paytas blocking Dawson and his fiancé that day.</p>

                <p>David Dobrik started his internet career with overnight success on video-sharing app Vine, then transitioned to YouTube in 2015, as the leader of a YouTube ensemble entitled the Vlog Squad. His video content typically entailed pranks and various comedy bit characters. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dobrik">1</a>] In 2021, his net worth was estimated to be between $25 million and $34 million.

                <p>Prominent vlog squad member Jason Nash began dating Trisha Paytas in the summer of 2017. [<a href="https://www.insider.com/trisha-paytas-david-dobrik-jason-nash-history-2021-2">3</a>] Paytas was frequently the target of Vlog Squad video content ‘pranks,’ or comedic bits, which traditionally ended with Paytas in tears or her being framed as philandering; Dobrik also captured some of the more serious relationship issues that came to light. [<a href="https://youtu.be/XeflDDanVFs">4</a>] Another ‘comedy bit’ perpetuated by Dobrik and Nash was persuading then 20 year old Tana Mongeau to have a threesome with Paytas and Nash (Paytas was 30 at the time and Nash was 45); Paytas had clearly and repeatedly stated her discomfort with this ‘joke.’ [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcDrTBAkbw">5</a>] In May 2019, Nash and Paytas broke up, and she subsequently accidentally overdosed on pills and alcohol.

But on the Frenemies podcast in 2020, hosted by Paytas and Ethan Klein of H3H3, Paytas’s accusations were validated when former members came on the podcast and confirmed her stories, including Seth Francois, former Vlog Squad member, alleging he was sexually assaulted and another describing the group dynamic as ‘cult-like.’ [<a href="https://www.insider.com/seth-francois-accuses-jason-nash-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-assault-2021-2">7</a>] [<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLQHHVDgzBl/">8</a>] </p>

Paytas backs up Hannah’s story, reporting that it was ‘a bad situation’ and another Vlog Squad member was instructed to purchase liquor for Hannah and her friends, who were underage at the time.

                <p>Following the publication of the article, Dobrik and Zeglaitis’s videos were demonetized on YouTube, and Dobrik lost sponsors such as SeatGeek, EA Sports, DoorDash, HBO Max, Facebook — and many more. Ethan Klein and Paytas hosted a livestream interviewing another Vlog Squad member, Jeff Wittek, who vehemently denied any involvement, but a time-stamped photograph, revealed later on the stream, showed him to be walking next to the victim who had to be held up by her friends.

The vlog depicted the Vlog Squad wakeboarding on a shallow lake, with David Dobrik operating an excavator that pulled and maneuvered the wakeboard. “When Wittek tries wakeboarding, Dobrik swings him even higher, then abruptly stops, causing Wittek to crash into the machine, then into the water with his foot still caught in the line.” [<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/06/david-dobrik-allegations-controversies-timeline.html#:~:text=﻿YouTube temporarily suspends David,a YouTube spokesperson told Insider.">11</a>][<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTuJLt6tz1I">12</a>] Wittek has since filed a lawsuit for $10 million in damages to Dobrik, due to the gargantuan medical bills he has accumulated due to injuries from the incident, including but not limited to, breaking his foot and hip, shattering his skull in nine places, tearing a ligament in his leg, and almost losing an eye.

                    <p>Paytas also has a complicated history with the online LGBT community — she has ‘come out’ multiple times as joke, claiming to either be ‘transracial,’ transgender, or even once a chicken nugget. But in addition to this, she has a history of using the f-slur [<a href="https://superfame.com/post/trisha-paytas-homophobic-racist-word/">1</a>] and suggesting that being gay is a choice.</p>

                    <p>Paytas has a history of repeating harmful anti-Semitic stereotypes, fetishizing Jewish men, and even making conflicting statements about Hitler. Paytas came under particular fire for her comments when she referred to her co-host on Frenenmies, Ethan Klein, as 'Jewy' for the split of profits from their podcasts. (see image below)</p>

                    <p>Additionally, Paytas has made conflicting comments regarding her knowledge of Hitler and the Holocaust. In 2020, on the podcast Frenemies, she claimed to not know about the Holocaust. But, she did; in a 2013 video, now deleted and removed from the Wayback Machine, entitled 'My Thoughts on Hitler,' Paytas expressed a specific interest in learning about the Holocaust and Hitler.</p>
                    <p>Paytas said in the video: "I'm not antisemitic in any, any way. I've had a lot of Jews inside of me, if you know what I'm saying [...] I love the Jews, I love them so much."
