        <p>Throughout her time on the Internet, Paytas has dodged accountability at every turn. There is no denying she built her initial platform off controversy, created by racism, anti-Semitism, and feeding into sexism and harmful stereotypes. She has directly profited off harming already marginalized people, and then doubled down by making a mockery of them. Being aware of her harmful actions is crucial to future interactions; whether or not she takes accountability is out of your and my hands, but our decision to engage with her or not is. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="paragraph-two">
        <p>Protect yourself from people online like Paytas, and do not let people online like her control the narrative around how we think of ourselves and how we evaluate the way we view others.  While the acts she has said and done are hurtful, discriminatory, and heinous, do your best to protect yourself and your relationship with yourself from harmful rhetoric. I am a human being before I am a woman and before I am an artist, and I am deserving of empathy and grace and care, as are you. Try to prevent letting the stereotypes and harmful ideas of who you are supposed to be perpetuated by people like Paytas prevent your acceptance of empathy, grace, and care.</p>
